<p>
    BSc. in Computer Science. A software developer (focusing on web technologies), a beginner <i>indepenedent</i> AI/ML researcher, and a philosophy enthusiast.
    I'm seeking to join a strong reasaerch programme (MSc, MPhil, or Phd) and/or a research software developement
    team that meets and challanges my software development and research interests and skills.
</p>

<p>
    As I'm still a wandering, beginner, independent research; I'm not yet comfrtable pinpointing
    what my research interests and goals exactaly are. However, in terms of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yann.lecun/posts/10152348155137143" target="_blank">professor Yann LeCunn's taxonomy
    of researchers</a>, I believe that my research goals fall somewhere in the intersection between the two
    groups:
</p>

<blockquote>
    (1) People who want to explain/understand learning (and perhaps intelligence) at the fundamental/theoretical level
    [..] (3) People who want to understand intelligence, build intelligent machines, and have a side interest in understanding how the brain works.
</blockquote>

<p>
    This probably why I'm drawn mostly to Reinforcement Learning as well as the
    theoretical aspects of Machine Learning.
</p>

<p>
    I currently work as a <strong>freelance full-stack web developer</strong>, taking advantage
    of the time flexiability to deepen my studies in AI.
